# AI-Image-Generating-App

# About
This project was my first time interacting with AIs!

With the boom of OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL â€¢ E 2 I got really curious about this technology so new and yet so great at the same time, so I ended up trying to make a really simple clone of Midjourney!

OpenAI's image generation API were used on this project.

# How it Works

Right off the bat, the Home page is shown when entering the web app. In there, the Community Showcase is available - showing all the images in the database. On hover, the prompts used to generate that image, name of the person that made the prompt and a button that allows the user to download the image are shown.
